"You enter the caves with Finn. You pull out your flashlight but Finn motions for you to put it away. As you walk, the darkness is punctuated by beams of light shining from the holes in the ceiling of the cave. Finn glances at you and you look back at him; his eyes are glowing in the dim light. \/\r\nSeveral minutes go by and the stone walls all look the same to you, but Finn leads you through forking tunnels with ease. As you walk, you run your hand along the cold stone and your fingers come away covered in a sticky substance. \/\r\n\"Over here,\" Finn says. You glance at him as he pauses at a divot in the stone. He brushes his fingertips across it, examining the wrinkles and cracks in the wall. You step closer and watch what he's doing over his shoulder. He presses a crease in the stone wall and you hear a grating sound. Suddenly, the wall is moving, opening up to reveal a small tunnel just large enough to crawl through. \/\r\nFinn motions for you to go forward and you go through. He follows close behind you. \/\r\nWhat you find on the other side is a large room, its walls made up by large arches - entrances to different tunnels - that look to you like strings of saliva, complementing the stalactites and stalagmites that surround the chamber like teeth. In the center of the room is one large stalagmite, its sharp tip covered in blood that drips down and congeals along its length. \/\r\n\"Amazing, isn't it?\" Finn says, \"I found it about a week ago and I did some research. Apparently, these caves were used for sacrifice by an ancient tribe called Altar. They believed that they had to sacrifice people and animals in order to appease the spirits of the forest.\" \/\r\nYou cross your arms in front of your chest nervously. \"Weren't you just telling me not to be creeped out by the woods?\" \/\r\n\"Well, you shouldn't be, $name. It's just superstition. It's an old legend, not-\" he cuts off abruptly. \/\r\nYou are both silent for a moment, listening to the sound of heavy footfalls, which seem to be approaching the chamber you're in. You share a look with Finn, who looks... almost scared. \"That's not possible. There shouldn't be anyone here,\" he whispers. \/\r\n[[12->Hide.]]\r\n[[13->Run.]]\r\n"
