"You backtrack until you find your way out of the ravine. The woods seem darker than before. Your eyes scan the forest floor for any landmarks, but you realize you were so caught up in what was happening that you don't know the way back. \/\r\nYou wander aimlessly, occasionally stopping to scratch small arrows into the trees, just to make sure you aren't going in circles. You wonder how your day could have turned into this. Maybe you should have followed the deer. Maybe you shouldn't have come here at all. \/\r\nYou take a deep breath and examine the landscape around you. Mid-August leaves crunch gently beneath your feet - not quite dry, not quite soft - as you stow through the forest, following it wherever it might lead you. \/\r\nThere are blueberry bushes up to your knees, swaying gently. You're surrounded by a maze of blue, green, red, and orange. Even in the fading sunlight, it's beautiful. \/\r\nSuddenly, you trip over something and fall to the ground. The leaves crunch beneath you and as you push yourself up, dirt sticks beneath your fingernails. You brush the leaves away to see what you tripped over. At first, you think it might be your phone, but as you pick it up and examine the scratched blue case, you realize it belongs to your best friend Finn. \/\r\n(\/He must have... just dropped it,\/) you think to yourself, unwilling to consider a more malevolent alternative. You jolt and drop the phone as it starts ringing. Cursing yourself for being so scared, you pick it up again and look at the caller ID. You blink several times in confusion. The caller is... you. You pat your pockets and realize your phone is gone. \/\r\nYour fingers shake as you answer the call and hold the phone up to your ear. There's a soft chuckle on the other end, so strange and yet oh-so-familiar.\r\n[[80->\"Who are you?\"]]\r\n[[60->\"Where's Finn?\"]]\r\n"
