"The deer steps in front of you. You fall to the ground, crawling backwards through the dirt as the deer approaches you once again. \"It's okay! It's okay!\" you whisper fervently. \/\r\nHe's above you now, dark red eyes like bleeding berries staring down at you. You close your eyes and relax your muscles. You read somewhere that death comes easier when you're relaxed, that in drunk driving incidents alcohol relaxes the system and the end is painless and quick. \/\r\nBut this isn't how you wanted to go. \/\r\nYou wait, counting the seconds. Ten seconds, then twenty, and finally a minute. Nothing happens. When you open your eyes, the deer's eyes are no longer red, but rather a dark shady brown. He looks at you curiously, ears twitching. But there is no malice. \/\r\nYou stand and hesitantly approach him. His posture is relaxed, and he motions with his antlers. Motions as if to say... (\/follow me\/). He begins to walk, then to trot. You stray behind him, your footsteps still unsure and ready to dart away at a moment's notice. \/\r\nThe ground beneath you begins to slope down as you enter what seems to be a deep ravine, like a rip in the earth's surface. The edges of the ravine are overshadowed by huge trees that block out almost all of the sun except for small, snaking patterns of light. You halt as you examine the ravine. \/\r\n[[40->Follow the deer.]]\r\n[[41->Brave the woods alone.]]\r\n"
