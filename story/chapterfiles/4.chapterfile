"You get out of the car, grabbing a flashlight from the glove compartment, and walk through the empty parking lot near the trailhead. The woods are quiet and there's no one around. Your car beeps as it locks, and you approach the statue that Finn told you about. It's been years since you visited Devil's Rock, but the memories are already flooding back. \/\r\nAs you reach the statue, you see Finn coming down the trail and waving. His curly brown hair is tucked under a blue beanie and he has a bright smile. \"You came!\" he yells. You give him a wave and zip up your jacket. It feels even colder than when you left. \/\r\nFinn runs the rest of the way down the trail and meets you at the statue. He's practically buzzing with energy. \"I knew you'd come!\" he said, \"Trust me, you'll be glad you did.\" \/\r\nYou roll your eyes, \"This better not be another let-down. I was just getting comfortable on the sofa when you called. Doesn't this place feel kind of creepy, anyways? I mean, no one comes out here to just take a hike.\" \/\r\n\"That's bullshit,\" he says, \"There's nothing scary here. This used to be part of the Yalma reservation, remember? They still come out here, sometimes. Relax, dude.\" \/\r\nYou shrug off your trepidation, \"Yeah, it's probably nothing.\" \/\r\nAs the two of you head up the trail, you glance back at the statue. You know that it's an old amalgamation of superstition and mythology, built by the natives who lived here to represent spirits that protect the forest. At the center of the sculpture is an insignia of the earth, half covered by a waning moon. There are small inscriptions that have long since faded into the stone and you can't make out their meaning. Coiled around the earth are the wolf, beetle, rabbit, and deer. All of the animals have their eyes closed and their teeth bared. You feel a shiver run down your spine, and you quickly follow Finn. \/\r\nAs the two of you approach the halfway point of the trail, you realize you forgot your phone. You nudge Finn's shoulder, \"I forgot my phone! I should go get it from my car.\" He looks disappointed but he nods. \/\r\n\"Okay, I'll wait here.\" \/\r\n[[8->Split up and get your phone.]]\r\n[[9->Stay with Finn.]]\r\n"
