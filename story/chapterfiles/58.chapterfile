"You make your way down the tunnel when suddenly the ground beneath you gives way and you topple down into darkness. Sharp rocks skid across your arms and scratch across the surface of your skin. Your head slams hard against something and you feel something warm and moist seeping down the back of your neck. \/\r\nFinally, you reach a landing and your fall is broken by a soft cushioning of moss. For a moment the world swims around you. It's suddenly bright. The air is humid, water congealing on the leaves of several large trees overhanging the grotto and dripping down into crevices. \/\r\nYou sit up, feeling liquid drenching your pants as you press into the moss. Slowly, you get to your feet. Fireflies flicker into life and spin around you in lazy spirals, swimming through the air and ducking between the leaves of trees. \/\r\nThe cave walls flicker with the light of the fireflies, painting strange patterns across their width. Each step you take squishes and soon you take off your shoes and walk barefoot, letting the warm water run across your feet as you step into the moss. For a moment, you feel safe. \/\r\nThe grotto stretches up into a rocky concave, narrowing as it approaches the highest point. When it gets too steep to walk, you grip the smooth surface of the rocks and begin to climb. Your breaths come in short bursts and your clothes hang loosely around you. \/\r\nYou reach the top and fall onto your knees for a moment, feeling exhaustion settle over you. The warm air is so comforting and the moss bed is so soft... but you know you need to keep going. With heavy limbs, you stand once more and continue towards the peak of the grotto, where you find a small altar. \/\r\nThe altar is pale yellowish white, like teeth. On it sits a mask made of the same bone-like substance, carved into the shape of a wolf with its fangs bared. It makes your skin crawl to look at it. \/\r\n[[70->Examine the altar.]]\r\n[[94->Try to find an exit.]]\r\n"
