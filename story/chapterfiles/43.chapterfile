"You grasp the helmet with both hands and lift it from the altar. Dust spills from it and floats in the air before settling and coating the floor in white particles. The helmet fits perfectly in your hands; its weight settles in your grip like it was meant to be. And when you place it on your head, it fits like it was made for you. \/\r\nAll the candles go out. Smoke whirls into the air and creates looming shapes. Where the shapes converge, they begin to circle around you, pushing towards you until you can\u2019t see anything through the dark haziness. From their presence emanates a desire, a want to consume. \/\r\nYou can't fight this. \/\r\nTendrils of something dark and translucent spiral around your arms and pull you in. (\/This, you realize, is what everything has led up to.\/) \/\r\nYou can feel something looking through your eyes, swerving to take in the spatial, material world. Slowly, you sink into your own body, into the corners and the dark spaces. A deep, hollow, aching hunger tears at the marrow of your bones. \/\r\nYou feel trapped in your body, and like you aren't alone in your head. But it doesn't feel wrong. This is what was meant to happen, and you know what you have to do. \/\r\nYou crawl through the hole in the wall and enter a room you haven't been in before. You realize now that you're at the foot of what looks like an amphitheater, carved from solid stone and large enough to seat hundreds. In the center of the highest stair is a plateau, on which sits a throne. You climb to the throne. \/\r\nFrom the seat of it, you pick up a sword. Its edge is jagged and ancient, but as sharp as glass. You want to scream as you cut your hand on it, but no sound comes out. Your feet guide themselves behind the throne, to where four tablets are built into the wall. \/\r\nA wolf, beetle, rabbit, and deer, as fierce as any beast. They all stare out at you from their stony outcroppings. Blood is spilling from your palm, and you feel a sense of urgency. This is the choice. \/\r\n[[90->Choose the wolf.]]\r\n[[106->Choose the beetle.]]\r\n[[103->Choose the rabbit.]]\r\n[[117->Choose the deer.]]\r\n"
