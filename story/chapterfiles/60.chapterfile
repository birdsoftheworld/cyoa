"\"Finn is where he's always been, where he belongs,\" says the voice, \"where (\/you\/) belong.\" \/\r\n\"What do you mean?\" \/\r\nSilence. \/\r\n \"What do you mean? Please!\" you ask again. \/\r\nA stick snaps behind you and you whip around, but you're alone. The trees stand silently at attention, staring down at you. The leaves of blueberry bushes are trembling, but there's no one around except you. \/\r\n\"Who is this?\" you try again, squeezing the phone tighter. \/\r\n\"It doesn't matter. We aren't doing this for ourselves, but for the woods.\" \/\r\n\"What do you mean 'we'?!\" \/\r\nA bag drops over your head and you scream in surprise. Your hands go to remove it but someone pins them to your chest. \"Get off!\" you yell, squirming and trying to fight blindly. Their grip tightens the bag around your head, and you feel yourself losing consciousness. Slowly, even the darkness around you fades away. \/\r\n[[69->Black out.]]\r\n"
