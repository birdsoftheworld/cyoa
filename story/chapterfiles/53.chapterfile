"You grip the roots and pull yourself up onto solid ground, but as you do you feel the creature behind you, mere inches away. You scream in pain as you feel canines pierce through your skin, in the crease where your neck meets your shoulder. The pain is red; warm, searing through you. \/\r\nYou struggle for a moment, but its grip on you is too strong. Your hair is wet with blood and your knees are buckling from the pain. The edge of the cliff dances through your field of view, so tempting... \/\r\nThe world smells damp, like fresh earth. The ground is coming up to meet you, and you realize that you're falling. It hurts so much, everything hurts, and you don't know what to do. \/\r\n[[67->Go limp.]]\r\n[[68->Fight.]]\r\n"
