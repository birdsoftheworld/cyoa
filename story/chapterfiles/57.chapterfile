"You pick up Finn's hat and continue down the tunnel. Your skin glistens with a cold sweat. The hairs on your arms rise, illuminated by the pale blue light streaming in from holes in the cave ceiling. You let out an exhale that spirals in the cold air in front of you. The tunnel begins to narrow and slopes downwards. Each step takes you further into darkness; further into the unknown. You try to walk carefully to keep your soles from slapping the ground audibly. \/\r\nFinally, the cave tunnel narrows so much that you have to stop. You eye the dark crevice that must lead to the rest of the tunnel. You let all the air out of your lungs and suck in your belly, scooting sideways between the rock walls. For a moment, you feel like you're stuck, but then you emerge into the light of a different part of the cave. \/\r\nIt takes a moment for your eyes to adjust. \/\r\nA small cavern swims into view in front of you, wavering and bright. You squint, trying to understand what you're looking at, until you realize that it's your own reflection, mirrored back at you from a thousand razor-sharp crystals. \/\r\nEvery inch of the cave is covered in gleaming crystal, some translucent and others a pale, milky white. Vines weave their way across the walls and the ground is coated with soft moss. It's beautiful, but terrifying. It feels like you've entered a place as sacred and ancient as a burial ground. \/\r\nYou walk carefully through the cave, which seems to stretch on about twenty yards before veering to the left. The crystals are enmeshed into the floor and walls, cutting across your path like tree roots. \/\r\nSuddenly, you stumble over a small, flat shard of crystal and fall onto the moss. The fall doesn't hurt, but you can feel moisture seep into your clothing. You sit up, suddenly dizzy. You haven't had any water today, much less gotten any sleep. \/\r\nYour eyes catch on something dark, hidden behind a rock. You approach it slowly, hesitantly. When you are close enough to see, you stumble back. Your limbs don't seem to work. \/\r\nIt's... Your mouth forms the words but they refuse to leave your tongue. It's Finn. It's Finn and he's dead. (\/It's Finn, and he's dead.\/) His pale blue eyes, open and staring into the ceiling, look so empty. \/\r\n\"Oh my god, oh my god,\" you keep repeating. \/\r\nSuddenly, a large white rabbit appears from near his body. It emerges from a pocket of crystals, its coat snow white and shining in the light. It cocks its head, one ear gently tipping to the side. Then it fixes you with crystallized eyes like opals, milky strands hidden between rays of sparkling blue and orange. \/\r\nYou don't dare to breathe as it begins to approach you. \/\r\n[[141->Stay where you are.]]\r\n[[145->Back away.]]\r\n"
