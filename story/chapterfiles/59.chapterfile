"The voice floats towards you atop the currents in the air, swirling and alien, like oil on water. Your legs continue forward instinctively. It's too close now, you can't stop. It's so familiar... you can't stand not knowing who's calling for you... \/\r\n(\/$name...\/) It's so close you could reach out and touch it. Your vision begins to blur as you let it lull over you. So calm... So, so soothing... \/\r\nBut as you step further into the darkness of the ravine, into the musty smell of earth and the damp ground underfoot, your arm starts to hurt where the deer stabbed you. The skin is raw and red. You bite your lip to distract yourself, but the pain of your arm is enough to make you stumble. Your feet lose purchase, even in their quest to reach the voice. \/\r\nThe voice fades out and suddenly all you can feel is the memory of the deer's antler stabbing through your skin as though it's still there. Each time you move, your muscle feels like it's tearing. You crawl forward, breathing heavily, until you reach the edge of a small pond, partially hidden by green foliage. You stare down at your reflection for a moment, clutching your injury. \/\r\nYour arm feels like it's on fire. You imagine the sensation of cold water against the wound and you don't even notice how close you are to the water until you feel the fabric of your pants soaking up cold liquid. Your arm hurts so much; a deep pulsing stab. You need to do something quickly or you aren't sure you'll be able to stand it much longer. \/\r\n[[73->Wash it.]]\r\n[[97->Immobilize it.]]\r\n[[90->Amputate.]]\r\n"
