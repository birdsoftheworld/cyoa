"You and Finn have been hiking for about twenty minutes when you come across a fork in the road. There's a sign, pointing down both directions. \u2018Devil's Rapids' says the right-hand part of the sign. The left side reads \u2018Devil's Caves', but the words have been scratched out. \/\r\nUnderneath, someone has written \u2018Turn Back'. \/\r\n\"Um, Finn...\" you say, nudging his shoulder. You point at the sign.\r\nHe looks at you and then laughs, \"You're way too on edge. We could turn back, but we're nearly there anyways. Please just trust me on this; I want to show you something. \/\r\nIf there are monsters, I promise I'll protect you.\" \/\r\nYou give him a smile but your heart hastens with each passing minute. The two of you arrive at the entrance to the caves and Finn stops. You stop, too, nearly crashing into him. \/\r\n\"You first,\" he says. \/\r\n\"No,\" you say. \/\r\nHe gives you a playful shove and you shove him back. \"Finn,\" you say quietly, \"I'm serious. This feels wrong.\" \/\r\n\"Stop being such a stick in the mud. I know what's in the woods. I swear nothing will hurt you while I'm with you, okay? Everything looks scarier at night, that's all,\" Finn says. \/\r\nYou stare into the darkness of the cave entrance, like looking into the maw of death, and your only thought is (\/hell, no\/). He seems to know what you're thinking, because he sighs and brushes past you as he enters the cave. After a moment, you follow behind. \/\r\n[[34->Enter the cave.]]\r\n"
