"\"This just in: NASA officials report unusual patterns in the moon's orbit. Could today's eclipse be more than we bargained for?\" the woman on the news asks, her perfectly painted lips enunciating each syllable clearly and slowly. \/\r\nShe continues, \"With the tides already fluctuating, tonight could be difficult for island nations. We have no way of knowing what effects these changes will have. Here's Dr. Michael Selver, NASA's director of public relations.\" \/\r\nYou check your watch. It's 5pm, nearly the end of the day. The TV news mutters on in the background. \/\r\n\"Do we have anything to fear from this unusual eclipse, doctor?\" \/\r\nAs you sip tea from a porcelain mug, you lose interest in the news and your gaze travels to the light mist outside the window, spiralling and weaving strange patterns in the air. Feeling content, you start to drift off. \/\r\nSuddenly, your phone rings, piercing through the silence. You make a face and grapple for it blindly, trying to turn off the loud noise. The screen is too dark to make out the caller ID, but the Pickup Call button is glowing and your phone falls on the floor, still vibrating. You sigh and sit up. \/\r\n[[2->Pick up the phone.]]\r\n[[3->Ignore it.]]\r\n"
