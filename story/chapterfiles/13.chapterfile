"You both freeze for a moment, and Finn motions for you to run. You need no encouragement. You start running. For a split second, you look back and everything goes into slow motion. You see someone entering the room just as you exit. And then they're gone, and the only thing you hear is your clattering footsteps down the tunnel. Finn's hand clutches yours and he squeezes tightly for a moment before splitting off from you at a fork in the tunnel. \/\r\nYou continue running, stopping for short bursts to listen for any sign of someone following you. When you finally take in silence, you breathe in the damp, musty air and slow to a quiet walk. You reach three branching pathways. Your blood chills when you examine them. Some instinctual part of you is screaming for you to turn back, but you know you need to keep moving forward. \/\r\nStraight ahead, you see a dimly lit tunnel with dark, viscous fluid dripping down the walls. You know it must be some sort of condensation, but some part of you thinks it might be blood. \/\r\nTo the left, there's a sound that you can't quite identify. It's deep and rumbling, like touching the ground as a train passes and feeling the vibrations deep within your bones. It sounds almost like... no, it can't be. There are no bears in these woods. There haven't been bears here since the 30s, when they were hunted for the fur trade. \/\r\nFinally, you look to the right. You take one step down the tunnel when a scream splits the air. Finn's scream. Your heart freezes inside your chest. You clutch your ears as the screaming continues, but you know you need to move. You need to make a choice. Now. \/\r\n[[20->Go straight.]]\r\n[[21->Go left.]]\r\n[[22->Go right.]]\r\n"
