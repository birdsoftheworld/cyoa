"You arrive at half past 5. The rain has stopped but there's a heavy mist coating the woods and the empty parking lot feels eerie. You arrive at the statue that Finn mentioned, but there's no sign of him. You pull your jacket tight around you for warmth. \/\r\nYou call Finn, but there's no response. Finally, you decide to go up the trail to look for him. He can't be that far away, since he called just 30 minutes ago. As you begin to head up the trail, something makes you glance back at the statue. \/\r\nYou pull out your flashlight and point it to see better. You remember seeing this statue before, back when you were younger. It was put up by the natives as a representation of the four spirits that protected the woods. At the center of the sculpture is an insignia of the earth, half covered by a waning moon. There are small inscriptions that have long since faded into the stone and you can't make out their meaning. Coiled around the earth are the wolf, beetle, rabbit, and deer. All of the animals have their eyes closed and their teeth bared. \/\r\nAs you are about to leave again, you see something at the foot of the statue. Upon closer examination, you realize with a shock that it's Finn's phone. Your missed calls are lined up on the notifications bar of the screen. You feel a shiver run down your spine, and you quickly head up the trail. \/\r\nAfter a couple minutes of walking, you reach a fork in the trail. There is a sign pointing to the left that says \"Devil's Rapids\", and another pointing to the right that says \"Devil's Caves\". \/\r\n[[10->Go to the Rapids.]]\r\n[[11->Go to the Caves.]]\r\n"
