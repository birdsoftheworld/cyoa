"You crawl along the ground blindly and follow the sound. Your eyes burn and you can still feel the phantom slice of acid against your skin. As your hands feel along the mud, you grip something smooth and cold and you stop moving. It feels like a stone, but along its surface you can feel a symbol etched into it. As you run your fingers along the symbol, you realize it's the outline of a wolf. \/\r\nYou put the stone into your pocket and freeze when you hear something move near you. \/\r\nYou can see only darkness, and the pulsing of your heart seems to converge in on you like a physical pressure around your throat. The mud is slick beneath your hands as you press yourself into the ground, praying that you're alone. \/\r\n[[65->Call for Finn.]]\r\n[[66->Don't move.]]\r\n"
