"You go down the tunnel straight ahead of you. Your running turns into speed walking, which eventually becomes walking. The tunnel seems to go on for miles. As you continue, the stone around you grows lighter and lighter, illuminated by the wavering gold light of candles hidden in pockets of the walls. The floor is smooth, like it has been scuffed by hundreds of feet over the years. \/\r\nIn the flickering light, you reach the end of the tunnel. Your eyes widen at the sight. \/\r\nThe stone has been carved into an alcove, in which rests a small shrine. It's made of a pale white substance that cracks and turns to dust beneath your fingers. In the center of the shrine is a helmet, made of bone. Two antlers are aligned along its crest, their sharp tines painting strange shadows on the wall. \/\r\nThe helmet is placed amongst fresh leaves and lit candles. The candle flames have barely eaten away at the wick, and the wax is only just beginning to melt. Someone has been here, maybe only moments ago. \/\r\nAlmost automatically, your hands reach for the helmet, aching to put it on. But as you touch its smooth surface, you notice that beside the shrine is a hole, just large enough for a person to fit through. Someone has painted a small marking above it: a white rabbit, eyes wide and body outstretched in a sprint.\/\r\nYou know you can't go back, and something about the shrine seems to call to you. Something about it seems... familiar. Once again, your hands reach for the helmet, but you take a deep breath and hesitate. \/\r\n[[43->Put on the helmet.]]\r\n[[101->Go through the hole.]]\r\n"
