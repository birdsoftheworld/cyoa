"You crouch forward and go through the wall, a cavern materializing around you. At first, it looks small, but as the darkness gives way you realize the ceiling stretches high above you, maybe twenty feet. \/\r\nBroken stalactites hang from the ceiling, their shards strewn across the floor. Some are covered in a dark substance. The stone floor has what appear to be claw marks, up to a meter long and curved like bows. You walk through the cavern into what gradually narrows into a tunnel. \/\r\nAs you pass beneath jagged stalactites feeling like you're moving in slow motion, a mist crosses in front of you. You aren't sure what the next tunnel will bring, but there's no way to go but further into the caves. \/\r\nYou wonder if you should bring a weapon with you. \/\r\n[[65->Break off a stalactite.]]\r\n[[66->Don't bring a weapon.]]\r\n"
