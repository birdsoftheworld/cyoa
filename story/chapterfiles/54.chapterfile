"You stumble through the woods quickly, your skin pale and coated with a layer of cold sweat. Your feet skid nervously to a halt every so often and you stand completely still to make sure that nothing is following you. You don't know what attacked you, and you aren't going to stay and find out. There's something out here in the woods with you... something unnatural. \/\r\nThe sky is turning to a pale indigo color, and you realize that the eclipse will happen within a couple of hours. You need to get home. You need to get out of here. \/\r\nYou come to a halt at the edge of a small meadow. You can see all the way across it to where the trees on the other side converge into darkness. The clearing is carpeted in soft yellow grass, dusted with wildflowers. There are a few birds and small animals at its edges, but in the center is the shape of something you can't quite make out. \/\r\nYou examine the trees at the edge of the clearing. They have small symbols etched into them - small white rabbits, with their limbs outstretched in a rapid sprint. In some, their eyes are closed, but in others they are open and as black as the night sky. Something moves in the woods. You back away from the darkness and into the clearing, spinning warily so you can see everything around you. \/\r\nA stick snaps and you walk backwards faster, before turning and running to the center of the clearing. You stop as you reach the edge of a small pond, perfectly circular, and marking the center of the meadow. The soft grass dips down suddenly into the small pond; a sheer drop-off into unknown depths. You can't see the bottom of the pond beneath the dark water. \/\r\nThen it comes out from the woods, dark and silent and fast. It's as if it's on all sides of you at once. It's a wolf, but with long gangly limbs like a human bent at the waist and crawling on all fours. You scream and try to back away, but there's nowhere to go. With a sharp inhale, you drop backwards into the pond. The water sucks you into an embrace and you drift down. \/\r\nYou know this is your only way out. \/\r\n[[91->Enter the caves.]]"
