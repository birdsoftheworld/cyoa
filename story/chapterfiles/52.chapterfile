"You throw the rock at the creature as it approaches you and it screams - half animal, half human. With the remaining shreds of energy you have, you drag your body onto land. Every muscle in your body screams and stretches. You nearly slip, but manage to drag yourself up and stand. \/\r\nBefore it can regain its senses, you start to sprint as fast as you can into the woods. It isn\u2019t chasing you yet, but you know it won\u2019t take long to catch up. \/\r\n(\/What is it?\/) Does it matter? You aren't going to die. Not today, not now. You don't want to die. \/\r\n[[86->Climb a tree.]]\r\n[[87->Keep running.]]\r\n"
