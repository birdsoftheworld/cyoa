You check your watch. It's 5pm, nearly the end of the day. You sip tea from your mug, watching the light mist outside the window spiralling and moving. You start to drift off. Suddenly, your phone rings. You make a face and grapple for it blindly, trying to turn off the loud noise. The screen is too dark to make out the caller ID, but the Pickup Call button is glowing and your phone falls on the floor, still vibrating. You sigh and sit up. /
[[2->Pick up the phone.]]
[[3->Ignore it.]]
`,
2: `
You groggily press the accept call button and hold it up to your ear. For a moment, there's only silence. /
"Hello?" you say. /
A voice chuckles. "Hey, $name!" /
You realize immediately that it's your friend Finn. You can hear excitement bubbling in his voice and you can picture his face lighting up. /
"Why are you calling so early?" you ask, still rubbing your eyes and trying to wake yourself up. /
"I need to show you something as soon as possible," he says, "something amazing. It's- well, I can't explain it now. You need to see it for yourself and when you do..." he pauses and lets out a breath. "Meet me in the woods, at the Devil's Rock trailhead. You know the place - it's got a big statue near it." /
"I know the place," you say. /
He laughs again, "Yeah, so meet me there." /
[[4->Take the car (15 minute drive).]]
[[5->Leave your parents the car and walk (30 minutes).]]
`,
3: `
You cancel the call. A moment later, a voicemail pops up and you push your phone away as you finally get up. The wood floor is cold under your feet. You pull on a sweater and walk out into the hallway. You are still half asleep as your feet guide you to the kitchen. /
It's cold, and outside you see that it's drizzling rain. You lean against the window and watch the way that the rain hits the leaves in the front yard. As you stare out into the grayish evening, something moves in the woods across the street. It's too fast for you to see, but the leaves of the trees are still trembling where it brushed against them. /
You pull on a coat over your sweater and step into rain boots. Just as you're about to leave, you remember to grab a flashlight. The front door creaks as you exit the house and cross the street. A shadow crosses behind the trees again, this time just slow enough for you to make out the shape of some kind of animal. /
You point your flashlight in its direction, but suddenly your phone starts ringing again. /
[[6->Investigate.]]
[[7->Answer the phone.]]
`,
4: `
You get out of the car, grabbing a flashlight from the glove compartment, and walk through the empty parking lot near the trailhead. The woods are quiet and there's no one around. Your car beeps as it locks, and you approach the statue that Finn told you about. It's been years since you visited Devil's Rock, and it's definitely one of the lesser known natural areas. /
As you reach the statue, you see Finn coming down the trail and waving. His curly brown hair is tucked under a blue beanie and he has a bright smile. "You came!" he yells. You give him a wave and zip up your jacket. It feels even colder than when you left. /
Finn runs the rest of the way down the trail and meets you at the statue. He's practically buzzing with energy. "I knew you'd come!" he said, "Trust me, you'll be glad you did." /
You roll your eyes, "This better not be another let-down. I was just getting comfortable on the sofa when you called. Doesn't this place feel kind of creepy, anyways? I mean, no one comes out here to just take a hike." /
"That's bullshit," he says, "There's nothing scary here. That Native American reservation runs along the other side of the rapids, and they come out here all the time. Relax, dude." /
You shrug off your trepidation, "Yeah, it's probably nothing." /
As the two of you head up the trail, you glance back at the statue. You know that it's an old amalgamation of superstition and mythology, built by the natives who lived here. It shows the great serpent coiled around the world and biting his own tail, the circle of life, but around the edges it has symbolic representations of the wolf, the coyote, the rabbit, and the deer. All of the animals have their eyes closed and their teeth bared. You feel a shiver run down your spine, and you quickly follow Finn. /
As the two of you approach the halfway point of the trail, you realize you forgot your phone. You nudge Finn's shoulder, "I forgot my phone! I should go get it from my car." He looks disappointed but he nods. /
"Okay, I'll wait here." /
[[8->Split up and get your phone.]]
[[9->Stay with Finn.]]
`,
5: `
You arrive at half past 5. The rain has stopped but there's a heavy mist coating the woods and the empty parking lot feels eerie. You arrive at the statue that Finn mentioned, but there's no sign of him. You pull your jacket tight around you for warmth. /
You call Finn, but there's no response. Finally, you decide to go up the trail to look for him. He can't be that far away, since he called just 30 minutes ago. As you begin to head up the trail, something makes you glance back at the statue. /
You pull out your flashlight and point it to see better. You remember seeing this statue before, back when you were younger. It was put up by the natives as a representation of shared superstitions and mythology across the world. At the center is the earth, a long serpent coiled along its circumference and biting its own tail. There are small inscriptions that have long since faded into the stone and you can't make out their meaning. At the edges of the statue are the wolf, bear, rabbit, and deer. All of the animals have their eyes closed and their teeth bared. /
As you are about to leave again, you see something at the foot of the statue. Upon closer examination, you realize with a shock that it's Finn's phone. Your missed calls are lined up on the notifications bar of the screen. You feel a shiver run down your spine, and you quickly head up the trail. /
After a couple minutes of walking, you reach a fork in the trail. There is a sign pointing to the left that says "Devil's Rapids", and another pointing to the right that says "Devil's Caves". /
[[10->Go to the Rapids.]]
[[11->Go to the Caves.]]
`,
6: `
You ignore the call again and pocket your phone as you approach the woods. You easily climb over the decayed wooden fence as you enter the forest. At first, everything is silent. Whatever you saw earlier - that fast-moving, dark shape - seems to be gone. /
But as you step further into the trees, something feels off. It's too quiet; the darkness is too dark. Your shoulder brushes the bark of a tree and it's warm, like something was just pressed against it. Even the ground is rumbling beneath your feet like a motor. /
You pull your sweater tight around yourself and let out a shaky breath. You're about to leave the forest when something snaps to your left. You quickly jolt away and try to track the movement. But there's nothing there. It feels like there's something in the woods with you... but there's nothing there. /
Then it emerges from the woods, every step silent against the decaying forest floor. A deer. His antlers are bared toward you and his eyes are completely red. He takes another step towards you and you back up against a tree. His ear twitches curiously as he continues approaching you. But his gait is slow and predatory, his antlers still held dangerously low. His every move makes you feel nervous and hunted. /
He's like a lion in the body of a deer. And he's only a foot away. Suddenly, he lunges towards you with his antlers. /
[[36->Hit him.]]
[[37->Run.]]
`,
7: `
You answer the phone the second time around. /
"It's m-me, Finn," stutters your friend Finn, obviously panicked, "Is this- are you there? Please, can you hear me?!" /
"I can hear you," you say slowly, turning your back to the swaying trees. /
"Thank god! Please, I need help. I'm at Devil's Rock, you know the old trailhead near your house? And... something's happened. Something's coming," his voice cuts off and you hear a low rumbling in the background of the call, "Please! Please help me!" /
The phone line cuts to static. /
Before you have time to think, something hits you in the back of your head. You're overwhelmed by the smell of dried blood, coppery and rotting. /
Your knees start to buckle. Almost immediately, you feel your consciousness slowly fading. Everything darkens and fades in and out of view as you hit the ground. Something reaches down over you. As the smell of blood permeates through your system, your eyes finally shut, and you black out. /
[[35->Wake up.]]
`,
8: `
You head back down the trail, glancing over your shoulder a couple of times. Finn waves. /
It only takes a couple of minutes to make it back to the parking lot. As soon as you step onto the wet concrete, a shiver crawls down your spine. There's something threatening in the emptiness, the silence. You cross to your car and it beeps open. /
Your phone is lying in the front seat. You don't remember leaving it, but you must have. Something brushes past the back of your neck and the hairs on your arms prickle. You turn quickly, but there's only empty space behind you. /
Something feels wrong. You put your phone in your pocket, shut the car door, and leave. As you prepare to go back up the trail, you wonder if there's a reason no one comes out here. Maybe you shouldn't have come. /
You glance at the statue that you saw earlier. The circle of life, the animals of the forest, all frozen in their never-ending dance. But something's... different. The wolf's eyes are open, staring right at you from their stone setting. Your breath hitches and you quickly head up the trail, trying not to look back over your shoulder. /
You hike up the trail until you reach the place that Finn was waiting for you. Should be waiting for you. Only, he's not there. You walk up the trail and then back down, but he's gone. There's no sign he was ever there. /
You pull out your phone and try calling him. For a moment, there's silence on the line, and then ringing. It takes only a moment for you to realize that the ringing isn't coming from your phone, it's coming from out there. /
It's coming from somewhere in the woods. /
[[15->Find the source of the ringing.]]
[[11->Go to the Devil's Caves and look for Finn there.]]
`,
9: `
You and Finn have been hiking for about twenty minutes when you come across a fork in the road. There's a sign, pointing down both directions. 'Sequoia Trail' says the right-hand part of the sign. The left side reads 'Devil's Caves', but the words have been scratched out. /
Underneath, someone has written 'Turn Back'. /
"Um, Finn..." you say, nudging Finn. You point at the sign. /
He looks at you and then laughs, "You're way too on edge. We could turn back, but we're nearly there anyways. Please just trust me on this; I want to show you something. /
If there are monsters, I promise I'll protect you." /
You give him a smile but your heart hastens its beating with each passing minute as you continue walking. You arrive at the entrance to the caves and Finn stops. You stop, too. /
"You first," he says. /
"No," you say. /
He gives you a playful shove and you shove him back. "Finn," you say quietly, "I'm serious. This feels wrong." /
"Stop being such a stick in the mud. I know what's in the woods. I swear nothing will hurt you while I'm with you, okay? Everything looks scarier at night, that's all," Finn says. /
You stare into the darkness of the cave entrance, like looking into the maw of death, and your only thought is (/hell, no/). He seems to know what you're thinking, because he sighs and brushes past you as he enters the cave. After a moment, you follow behind. /
[[34->Enter the cave.]]
`,
10: `
You hike about half a mile toward Devil's Rapids. The woods are silent today. Part of your brain is busy worrying about Finn and whatever he could have found, but part of you is just enjoying the silence and the open air. /
You come to a small branching path from the main trail and you vaguely remember that this must lead to the Yalma Stream. You shrug to yourself and head down the path toward the river's edge, brushing ferns and blueberry bushes with your fingertips. /
When you reach the small beach by the stream, you take off your shoes and feel the smooth stones press into the pads of your feet. The rushing water and gentle moisture in the air feels clean and calming. But as you approach the water's edge, you notice something strange moving amongst the stones of the beach. /
It's fish, you realize. Dozens of small, silvery fish are laying on the beach, writhing and struggling to breathe on land. It's as if, you think to yourself, they've just been transported out of the water and onto land. As you watch them gasping for air, one slowly stops moving and goes limp. Dead. /
[[14->Put the fish back into the water.]]
[[26->Leave them, go back to the trail.]]
`,
11: `
You arrive at the Devil's Caves when you can't see the sun in the sky anymore. There's a sign in front of the caves that's squeaking as it hangs limply off its post. You fight back your apprehension and step into the cave, feeling as though you've plunged into the depths of the ocean. It's cold. /
There's a chill in the air like the dead rising. Each ray of light piercing through the top of the cave looks like someone's breath spiralling in the cool air. Why could Finn have wanted to meet here? You continue walking and your footsteps echo on the floor of the cave. /
The walls become damp with moisture as you gradually reach the underbelly of the cave system. Water drips from massive stalactites that hang threateningly just inches above your head. Something makes you uneasy, but you don't know what. You stop when you reach a place where the tunnel branches in two directions. /
A scream splits the air. You stumble in shock and fall against the wall. 
"Help! Help me, please! $name, please!" The screaming continues, like the sound of a saw piercing into metal, grating and unbearable. You press your hands onto your ears and try to calm your racing heart. Then the screams cut off. /
You glance down the tunnel where the screaming originated, then to the right where there's something dark lying on the floor of the tunnel. It looks almost like... Finn's hat. You don't know what to do, but you've never been this scared. /
[[16->Follow the screaming.]]
[[17->Go towards Finn's hat.]]
`,
12: `
You duck behind the stalagmites, feeling something wet and viscous seeping into your shirt where your back is pressed to the wall. Your breaths come in short bursts. You hear Finn's shoes clatter across the stone as he hides across the room. /
Something enters the room. You can't see it or hear it, but you feel it like a slithering pressure across your skin. You don't dare to look behind the stalagmites. You hold your breath as you feel the thing approaching, feel the pressure tighten around your neck. /
And then it's gone, for only a moment. There's a thump across the room and Finn screams. You hear something scrape across the floor, a grating sound like metal on metal. /
[[19->Help Finn.]]
[[18->Keep hiding.]]
`,
13: `
You both freeze for a moment, and Finn motions for you to run. You need no encouragement. You start running. For a split second, you look back and everything goes into slow motion. You see someone entering the room just as you exit. And then they're gone, and the only thing you hear is your clattering footsteps down the tunnel. Finn's hand clutches yours and he squeezes tightly for a moment before splitting off from you at a fork in the tunnel. /
You continue running, stopping for short bursts to listen for any sign of someone following you. When you finally take in silence, you breathe in the damp, musty air and slow to a quiet walk. You reach three branching pathways. Your blood chills when you examine them. Some instinctual part of you is screaming for you to turn back, but you know you need to keep moving forward. /
Straight ahead, you see a dimly lit tunnel with dark, viscous fluid dripping down the walls. You know it must be some sort of condensation, but some part of you believes it's blood. /
To the left, there's a sound that you can't quite identify. It's deep and rumbling, like touching the ground as a train passes and feeling the vibrations electrifying your bones. It sounds almost like... no, it can't be. There are no bears in these woods. If you learned one thing from your history class, it was that all the bears in the area were hunted to extinction during the fur trade. /
Finally, you decide you should go right. You start to step down the tunnel when a scream splits the area. Finn's scream. Your heart freezes and stops beating for a moment. You clutch your ears as the screaming continues, but you know you need to move. Now. /
[[20->Go straight.]]
[[21->Go left.]]
[[22->Follow the screaming.]]
`,
14: `
You stoop down and gently pick up one of the fish. You feel its gills expanded and contracting as it gasps for air. It gleams silver in the waning sunlight, and as you carefully place it back in the water, it disappears into the cold stream. The waves rush across a bed of flat stones and you think you see the fish darting through the water.
You don't let yourself pause. You rush back to the other fish and begin collected them in your arms. Your heart jolts each time it feels like they're going to slip from your grip. You rush back and forth, moving them back into the water in groups of four or five.
Several are already dead, their bodies lying limp against the rocks, their silver-painted scales already fading to grey.
You continue your work until the sun is pink in the sky and there is only one fish left lying on the beach. You crouch down beside its tiny form and it convulses, gills gaping and tail flipping back and forth. But as you begin to lift it, it gazes at you with eyes that glow as red as raspberries.
[[23->Put the fish in the water.]]
[[26->Leave the fish on land.]]
`,
15: `
You follow the sound of Finn's ringtone; a soft, lilting sound, like the whisper of a lullaby hidden between the trees. Mid August leaves crunch gently beneath your feet - not quite dry, not quite soft - as you stow through the forest, following the ringing wherever it might lead you. /
There are blueberry bushes up to your knees, swaying gently. You're surrounded by a maze of blue, green, red, and orange. Even in the fading sunlight, it's beautiful. (/I don't come out here nearly enough.../) you think to yourself. /
Finn's ringtone cuts off abruptly and you pull out your phone to call him again. You open up his contact and look at his profile picture for a moment. The way his smiling eyes and dimples catch the sunlight remind you why you came out here in the first place. /
As you press the call button, something snaps loudly from above you. You freeze. From the corner of your eye, you see Finn's phone lying amongst the leaves only a few feet away from you. It glows and buzzes incessantly. /
Something wet drops onto you from above and you glance down to see black liquid seeping down the back of your hand. Black liquid… but as it drips down your skin it leaves a red trail like a bloodstain. You hold your breath as once again, a sharp snap cleaves through the air, coming from the tree above you. /
[[32->Look up.]]
[[31->Run.]]
`,
16: `
You walk down the tunnel as quietly as you can. The screaming has stopped, but you hear muffled sounds, like someone is in pain. The walls feel like they're closing in you. You've always wondered whether you would have the guts to be brave in a dangerous situation, and now you'll know. /
(/But do you really want to know? Do you really want to have to make that choice?/) /
As the path becomes darker, you realize you need to use your flashlight. You pull it out and shade it with one hand so whatever took Finn can't see you approaching. As you walk, the darkness is punctuated only by beams of light shining from the holes in the ceiling of the cave. /
Several minutes go by and the stone walls all look the same to you. You know you must be lost already, but you continue to follow the faint muted sounds. You run your hand along the cold stone and your fingers come away covered in a sticky substance. Finally, you reach an end to the tunnel, and you switch off your flashlight as you approach what must be a cavern. As you reach the entrance, you peer inside, staying close to the wall. /
The opening leads into a large chamber, its walls made up by large arches - entrances to different tunnels - that look to you like strings of saliva, complementing the stalactites and stalagmites that surround the chamber like teeth. In the center of the room is one large stalagmite, its sharp tip covered in blood that drips down and congeals along its length. /
Tied in the center of the room is Finn, his hands bound behind his back and his torso secured to the circumference of the stalagmite. His head hangs to the side so his eyes are hidden from view. After seeing that the rest of the chamber is empty, you run to his side. /
His hair has dried blood along the right side, and he isn't moving. His mouth is gagged with a thick woven material. You feel for his pulse. It's barely there, only a faint thrumming. "Finn!" you whisper, close to his ear, "Please wake up, Finn." /
He startles, but when his eyes land on yours his body relaxes. He starts whimpering and making sounds through the gag. /
[[28->Ungag Finn.]]
[[29->Untie Finn.]]
`,
17: `
You walk down the tunnel as quietly as you can. You reach Finn's hat and use your foot to turn it over, making sure nothing's inside. Then you pick it up carefully, examining the gray material. As you turn it over in your hands, you realize there's dried blood on the inside, staining it a dark color. A chill rolls down your spine. (/What if this isn't Finn's hat?/) It sounds silly, but you want it to be true. /
You stuff the hat in your back pocket and take a deep breath. You haven't always been the bravest person, but you need to do this. You need to do this for Finn. /
As the path becomes darker, you pull out your flashlight. You shade the beam with one hand so that whatever is here can't see you approaching. As you walk, the darkness is punctuated only by beams of light shining from the holes in the ceiling of the cave. /
Several minutes go by and the stone walls all look the same to you. You know you must be lost already, but you continue forward anyways. You run your hand along the cold stone and your fingers come away covered in a sticky substance. Finally, you reach an end to the tunnel, and you switch off your flashlight as you approach what must be a cavern. As you reach the entrance, you peer inside, staying close to the wall. /
The opening leads into a large chamber, its walls made up by large arches - entrances to different tunnels - that look to you like strings of saliva, complementing the stalactites and stalagmites that surround the chamber like teeth. In the center of the room is one large stalagmite, its sharp tip covered in blood that drips down and congeals along its length. /
The floor of the cavern has scuff marks like someone was dragged through. You follow the marks to the large stalagmite, where they veer to the right. But as you reach the stalagmite, something makes you stop. You point your flashlight at it. /
On the side of the stalagmite, hardly level with your knees, is a small inscription. It's uneven, possibly scratched in with something blunt. /
You squint to read it, and when you do your heart skips a beat. (/$name/), it says. And you know there's only one person whose handwriting loops and curves like that. There's only one person who would scratch your name into the limestone and leave you a sign. Finn is here, and he needs help. /
You stand up and look at the scuff marks across the floor. There's a point in everyone's life when they need to be a hero. Maybe this is yours. /
[[57->Follow.]]
`,
18: `
Finn's screams continue as his voice slowly fades away. You hear him being dragged down one of the tunnels. You squeeze your eyes shut and you can't feel anything but your heart pulsing rapidly.
When you can't hear his screams anymore, you creep out from behind the stalagmites. Your eyes scan the room until they reach the tunnel that you know Finn was taken into. Your hand automatically goes to your back pocket, feeling for the familiar outline of your phone. But it's gone. You remember that you left it in the car earlier.
Your skin is alive with what feels like electricity, running along the threads of adrenaline in your system. You can't stand still. You need to... you need to do something, anything. You can't let this happen to Finn, but you're scared.
[[42->Look for Finn.]]
[[42->Try to escape.]]
`,
19: `
You come out from behind the stalagmites and see Finn's outline disappear down a tunnel as something drags him along the ground. /
"Finn!" you yell. /
You chase after him but he's gone. Disappeared. You reach a dead end in the tunnel and for a moment, you feel like can't breathe. He can't just be... gone. You close your eyes and let out a breath, sliding to the ground with your back against the cold stone wall.  You wonder if he's dead. And, if he is, is this all your fault? /
When you open your eyes, your gaze catches on something on the wall across from you. You crawl forward on your knees and touch the wall carefully, examining it. You realize that the walls of the tunnel have strange markings across their length. They are drawn in charcoal and the rough scratches of a stone. Your eyes scan across them and stop when you see shapes drawn in red. In front of you, you see a depiction of a group of people in black robes circling a fire. The next symbol shows what you know must be Devil's Rapids, but the water has been replaced with blood and at the bottom of the rapids the blood pools and there's something rising from it. Something terrifying. /
The next symbol is smudged, but you can only make out the faint outline of antlers. The one after is crystal clear; it could have been drawn minutes ago. It shows the robed people again, but this time they are bowing in front of a red-eyed deer. All of the drawings are aligned in a circle around a depiction of the moon. /
Your fingers touch the edges of the moon absentmindedly and you gasp in surprise as the stone circle recedes into the wall. There's a grating sound and then a small entrance opens in the wall. /
[[64->Go through.]]
`, 
20: `
As you continue down the tunnel, it grows lighter and lighter, illuminated by the wavering gold light of candles. The floor is smooth, like it has been scuffed by hundreds of feet over the years. /
In the flickering light, you reach the end of the tunnel. Your eyes widen at the sight. /
The stone has been carved into an alcove, in which rests a small shrine. It's made of a pale white substance that cracks and turns to dust beneath your fingers. In the center of the shrine is a helmet, made of bone. Two antlers are aligned along its crest, their sharp tines painting strange shadows on the wall. /
The helmet is placed amongst fresh leaves and lit candles. The candle flames have barely eaten away at the wick, and the wax is only just beginning to melt. Someone has been here, maybe only moments ago. /
Almost automatically, your hands reach for the helmet, aching to put it on. But as you touch its smooth surface, you notice that behind the shrine is a small hole, just large enough for a person to fit through. /
You know you can't go back, and something about the shrine seems to call to you. Something about it seems… familiar. Once again, your hands reach for the helmet, but you take a deep breath and pull them away. /
[[43->Put on the helmet.]]
[[101->Go through the hole.]]
`,
21: `
You step into the growling cave, and immediately feel a sense of regret. (/Why did I do that?/) you ponder. /
You don't see it, but some creature lurks in the darkness. The same growling you heard before you entered is slowly getting louder as you (for some reason) continue deeper. Suddenly, the growling halts; it must have heard you. You cautiously take a step forward. In the process, you kick some pebbles forward, making an echoing (/clack/). /
In an instant, something dark descends on you from above. You have no time to react. /
You are dead. 
`,
22: `
You begin to sprint down the tunnel and Finn's voice grows closer and closer. Your footsteps clatter against the stone. But you realize... it's not quite Finn's voice. 
You shouldn't have come here. It's already too late. /
It comes from behind you, and in an instant you fall to the ground, slipping on your own blood. /
You are dead.
`,
23: `
You pick up the fish, trying to ignore the way his scarlet eyes track your every movement. Where the other fish were flopping and gasping in your hands, this fish is motionless, dead except for his shifting eyes. /
"It's okay, little guy," you say under your breath, more for your own benefit than for the fish. /
Your hands are shaking as you carry him to the stream's edge. As you begin to near the water, he begins to shake. At first, it's only a small tremble. But it grows to a rhythmic shivering, its tempo as fast as the thud of your heart. /
You lower him the last few inches and he quakes violently in your hands, spasming between your fingers. You let go of him in shock, but he swings around and latches onto your hand with needle-sharp teeth. /
Something sticky oozes from beneath his scales as his teeth dig into your skin. You scream in pain, trying to force him into the stream, but his grip is too strong. His eyes are fading from red to black. /
[[24->Try to push him off.]]
[[25->Hit him with a rock.]]
`,
24: `
You flail and scream, pushing at him with your free hand. His eyes flare red and black like strobe lights, but finally he releases you and falls onto the beach. You back away as he flops from side to side, his tail drawing strange, fluctuating patterns in the sand. /
You pick up a stick. It feels heavy in your hand, heavier than wood should feel. The tip is sharp enough to do the job… but should you? /
[[44->Kill him.]]
[[45->Spare him.]]
`,
25: `
As you hit the silvery-gray aquatic beast, you see its eyes flare red, before it promptly explodes into a burst of a purple substance. Immediately, you feel a searing pain all over. The fluid starts to smoke, and it smells like burning plastic. /
(/Could I have avoided this brutal fate had I made better choices?/) you wonder. Your vision fades. /
You are dead.
`,
26: `
You make it to the rapids as the sun begins to set, touching down on the peaks of the horizon. /
You climb to the clifftop. The rapids run below - screaming and rushing over river rocks and then toppling off of the falls. Cresting the edge of the cliff above the rapids, only a few feet from you, is Devil's Rock. You approach it with a sense of awe. /
You've never seen it before, but it still feels familiar. It's black like obsidian, with inscriptions sketched in white. Along one side is unfamiliar writing in another language, printed in small tilted handwriting. On the other side of the rock's oblong form is a drawing of a rabbit. Its eyes are wide and its gaze rests far away, on the horizon. /
You move closer to the rock and examine the way that the inscriptions lie gently across the stone, like they were carved by the river itself. /
You freeze when you feel something behind you, like a sixth sense. There's something, or someone, there and you can feel their breath. You can't hear anything over the crashing of the rapids, but your heart begins to race. /
[[30->Don't move.]]
[[27->Turn around.]]
`,

You turn around quickly, bracing your fists for a fight, but see that it's only Finn and lower your hands. His eyes are bright in the sunlight, and he smells like fresh dirt; like the earth. /
"Whoa there!" he says, chuckling, "I'm not the bad guy." He takes a step back from you. /
"Why were you standing behind me like that?" you ask him, brow furrowed. He shifts his weight and smiles again. /
"I was going to scare you. I didn't realize you were so on edge. My bad, $name." /
You give him a small smile, but something feels wrong. You can't identify the feeling, but it's strong. /
"Look," he says, "Can we go? I'm sorry for being creepy earlier, but now I want to show you something. We need to get there before the sun sets, and it’s already like 6:30." He takes a step closer to you. /
"You're acting weird," you say. /
He laughs again and shrugs. "No, you are. Have you considered maybe you're the one who's acting weird? I called and you came, and I just want to show you what I've found. Why are you suddenly so skeptical?" /
You soften your expression. "Okay, sorry. Maybe I just don't like the woods - it's kind of creepy out here in the evening." /
"Don’t worry, there's nothing out here but us. We need to go now if we're going to make it in time, okay? /
You trust me, don't you?" /
He tilts his head at you, his gaze burning through yours. /
"It would be a shame if you didn't." /
[[46->Trust Finn.]]
[[47->Don't trust Finn.]]
`,
28: `
You pull at the gag. His dark brown eyes are glassy and staring past you. Finally, you feel the thick material of the gag give way and it falls from his mouth. He gasps for air for a moment. /
You immediately move on to the ropes binding him to the stalagmite. /
"B..." he sobs, "Behind you!" /
He tugs hard at his ropes to no avail. "He's behind you! Don't let me die, please don't let me die, $name, don't let me die like this." /
You feel a soft breeze from behind you. It tickles the skin of your neck and makes your hair prickle. /
[[51->Try to untie Finn quickly.]]
[[50->Turn around.]]
`,
29: `
You start untying Finn, your hands shaking as you pull at the rope and your nails scrape against his arm. You free him from the stalagmite, but his hands are still bound and he screams through his gag. As you pull him up, he motions with his head toward one of the tunnels. /
The two of you start to run down the tunnels, Finn slightly ahead of you. When you reach a fork in the tunnels, Finn goes to the right automatically. Like he's been here before. Like he's done this before. He checks to make sure you're following. /
When you reach a dip in the tunnel, Finn stops abruptly and you crash into him, knocking both of you to the floor. He makes a muffled sound through his gag, then stands up. You stare in shock as he turns his back to the cave wall and uses his bound hands to press a button on the wall that you didn't see before. /
The stone grates and a small opening entrances in the cave wall. You hear footsteps growing closer, clapping against stone in the distance. He motions silently for you to go through. /
[[76->Go through.]]
[[77->Question Finn.]]
`,
30: `
Something brushes past you and you squeeze your eyes shut in fear. There's a low growl and then you feel something - something almost like human hands - shove you forward. /
You nearly fall into the rapids, but your hands grapple for the exposed roots of a tree and you scream as your body is suspended in the air, feet kicking out into empty air. You cling onto the roots of the tree with sweaty palms. /
You know the creature has reached you when it kicks up rocks and dirt that tumble past you and into the river. You still can't see what it is; it's too fast. Something lashes out at you and cuts open up on your arm. Ribbons of blood make it hard to keep holding on. /
You use all of your weight to try to throw your body back onto the cliff. You're half on the land, everything past your waist still hanging off the edge of the world. As you feel yourself begin to slip, the creature lets out a deep growl that rocks the earth. You can just make out the shape of a large rock by your shoulder. /
[[52->Throw the rock.]]
[[53->Try to climb onto land.]]
`,
31: `
You hit the ground running. Without looking up, you know that whatever's there has given chase. Leaves crunch as it drops to the ground and then you hear a howl. It's something deep and animalistic, rumbling the ground beneath.
You nearly trip as the growling from behind you seems to close in around like the earth itself is swallowing you up. You feel suffocated. You're still too scared to look behind you. Your eyes dart from tree to tree, looking for an escape or a foothold. Something, anything, to get away. /
Your fight-or-flight is in full force and the adrenaline coursing through you feels like a shot of ice right into your veins. You make a sharp turn and topple over a bush, but quickly right yourself. As you sprint, you realize you can't hear anything but your own footsteps. /
You don't dare to stop running. /
Then you feel it right behind you. Hot breath only inches from your neck, and then the sensation of the air being drawn away in an inhale. As you scan the area in front of you, you realize that you've cornered yourself. You're approaching a cliff's edge, towering over the Devil's Rapids. /
But you can't turn back. Won't turn back. Everything seems to move in slow motion for a moment as you feel yourself panicking. There, at the very tip of the cliff, is a tree, swaying silently. Its exposed roots hang off the side of the cliff and it's held in place only by withering soil. /
You realize that you only have two choices if you want to make it out of this alive. /
[[39->Grab hold of the exposed tree roots.]]
[[38->Jump into the Rapids.]]
`,
32: `
You look up. The only thing that you see is empty black eyes as something drops on you from above. Your body goes limp. Claws tear into your skin and you are thrown back against the trunk of the tree. There's a splitting pain radiating from your spine and making your legs go numb. /
Finn's phone is still ringing from somewhere nearby. You can feel the vibrations shaking the ground beneath you. The darkness seems to converge on you and you think you're about to die. This is how it ends. /
Suddenly, you hear a howling in the distance. In an instant, whatever is attacking you is gone and retreating into the woods, and you collapse to the ground. Everything hurts, and even in the dark you can make out dark blood ebbing across the fabric of your shirt. /
[[54->Leave.]]
[[55->Investigate the area.]]
`,
33: `
"You- you aren't Finn," you say, watching as his hopeful expression morphs into something darker. He reaches for you, much faster than he was moving before, but it's too late. You release your grip and close your eyes as your body plummets from the edge of the cliff. /
There's no going back now. /
It feels like all the air has been sucked from your lungs in a gasp, like you're falling through a vacuum. For a moment, you feel as weightless as the air around you. But then you're back in your body. /
Your crash through a wall of cold as you fall into the water. /
You can't breathe. Your limbs are useless against the power of the currents, doing everything to pin your beneath the water. You flail but all you can see and feel is darkness pressing in around you. /
You can feel yourself losing consciousness. Your movements are slower, weaker. The pain in your lungs fades to a dull throbbing. And then finally, everything goes dark. /
[[74->Black out.]]
`,
34: `
You enter the caves with Finn. You pull out your flashlight but Finn motions for you to put it away. As you walk, the darkness is punctuated by beams of light shining from the holes in the ceiling of the cave. Finn glances at you and you look back; his eyes are dark in the dim light. /
Several minutes go by and the stone walls all look the same to you, but Finn leads you through forking tunnels with ease. You run your hand along the cold stone and your fingers come away covered in a sticky substance. /
"Over here," Finn says. You glance at him as he pauses at a divot in the stone. He brushes his fingertips across it, examining the wrinkles and cracks in the wall. You step closer and watch what he's doing over his shoulder. He presses a crease in the stone wall and you hear a grating sound. Suddenly, the wall is moving, opening up to reveal a small tunnel just large enough to crawl through. /
Finn motions for you to go forward and you go through. He follows close behind you. /
What you find on the other side is a large room, its walls made up by large arches - entrances to different tunnels - that look to you like strings of saliva, complementing the stalactites and stalagmites that surround the chamber like teeth. In the center of the room is one large stalagmite, its sharp tip covered in blood that drips down and congeals along its length. /
"Amazing, isn't it?" Finn says, "I found it about a week ago and I did some research. Apparently, these caves were used for sacrifice by ancient tribes similar to the Aztecs. They believed that they had to sacrifice people and animals in order to appease the spirit of the forest." /
You cross your arms in front of your chest nervously. "Weren't you just telling me not to be creeped out by the woods?" /
"Well, you shouldn't be, $name. It's just superstition. It's an old legend, not-" he cuts off abruptly. /
You are both silent for a moment, listening to the sound of heavy footfalls, which seem to be approaching the chamber you're in. You share a look with Finn, who looks… almost scared. "That's not possible. There shouldn't be anyone here," he whispers. /
[[12->Hide.]]
[[13->Run.]]
`,
35: `
You wake up in an unfamiliar, dark place. /
There are huge stalactites and stalagmites everywhere, covering every surface like a maw full of teeth. It's dark and eerily quiet; a cave where there isn't even an echo to break the silence. In the dim light, you can just make out the walls of the cave and several tunnels leading out of it. You see your flashlight lying abandoned on the ground several feet away. You try to move but you realize that you're tied to something and gagged. /
From the corner of your eye, you can see that you are bound to a giant stalagmite. Your wrists are tied to a rope that goes tightly around its circumference. You test at the rope and are washed with a sudden sense of hopeless as you feel no give in the thick material. /
[[78->Try to get the ropes off.]]
[[79->Try to reach your flashlight.]]
`,
36: `
You pick up a decaying branch from the ground and hit the deer. It recoils, eyes widening. Before you can react, the deer rams its antler at you. /
Your arm is bleeding and you quickly back away, trying to shield yourself. Blood spills down your arm and pools in the crook of your elbow. You hiss in pain and the deer approaches you again, his antlers held out like a sacrifice. He sniffs and his hoof scrapes against the dirt. He lowers his head one final inch lower and then he begins to run at you. /
You try to run but behind you is a closely nested clump of trees. You spin for a moment, unsure what to do. Time seems to slow down as the deer runs towards you and your grip tightens around the branch you're holding. /
[[55->Hit the deer with the branch.]]
[[56->Try to calm the deer down.]]
`,
37: `
You sprint through the woods, nearly tripping on tree roots. Your heart is beating so fast that you can feel it squeezing blood down your fingertips. The branches of trees rip at your shirtsleeves with greedy fingers and whip small red lines into your skin. /
The deer catches up to you with no trouble and jumps in front of you. You skid to a halt and fall to the ground, crawling backwards through the dirt as the deer approaches you once again. /
He's above you now, dark red eyes like bleeding berries staring down at you. You close your eyes and relax your muscles. You read somewhere that death comes easier when you're relaxed, that in drunk driving incidents alcohol relaxes the system and the end is painless and quick. /
But this isn't how you wanted to go. /
You wait, counting the seconds. Ten seconds, then twenty, and finally a minute. Nothing happens. When you open your eyes, the deer's eyes are no longer red, but rather a dark shady brown. He looks at you curiously, ears twitching. But there is no malice. /
You stand and hesitantly approach him. His posture is relaxed, and he motions with his antlers. Motions as if to say... (/follow me/). He begins to walk, then to trot. You stray behind him, your footsteps still unsure and ready to dart away at a moment's notice. /
The ground beneath you begins to slope down as you enter what seems to be a deep ravine, like a rip in the earth's surface. The edges of the ravine are overshadowed by huge trees that block out almost all of the sun except for small, snaking patterns of light. You halt as you examine the ravine. /
[[40->Follow the deer.]]
[[41->Brave the woods alone.]]
`,
38: `
You continue to sprint towards the edge of the cliff, heart beating out of your chest. The sheer drop below is feet away, then inches, and then there's nothing beneath you. You close your eyes as you plummet from the edge of the cliff and into the empty air. /
There's no going back now. /
It feels like all the air has been sucked from your lungs in a gasp, like you're falling through a vacuum. For a moment, you feel as weightless as the air around you. But then you're back in your body. /
Your crash through a wall of cold as you fall into the water. /
You can't breathe. Your limbs are useless against the power of the currents, doing everything to pin your beneath the water. You flail but all you can see and feel is darkness pressing in around you. /
You can feel yourself losing consciousness. Your movements are slower, weaker. The pain in your lungs fades to a dull throbbing. And then finally, everything goes dark. /
[[74->Black out.]]
`,
39: `
As you topple off the cliff, you manage to grab hold of the tree's exposed roots, but your weight pulls them loose from the soil. You hang precariously at the edge of the world, scared out of your mind. You close your eyes and listen to the rushing water below. (/What if this is the last sound I hear?/) /
"$name," says a voice. You startle and nearly lose your grip on the roots. When you look up, you see a familiar face. /
Finn is crouched at the edge of the cliff, reaching out a hand to you. He's smiling, but his eyes have dark purple crescents beneath them. All you can do is stare at him, your muscles screaming and straining beneath your skin. /
"Finn?" you ask. Not a question. /
"Take my hand," he says, "I know you can't hold on much longer, just let me help you." /
Your fingers twitch, but you hesitate, still unsure. "Where have you been? Why didn't you wait? Why didn't you believe me when I said we need to leave?!" /
Finn looks concerned now. He crawls forward on his knees and reached further towards you. "We can talk about this later. Please come here." /
"There's something in the woods, Finn," you whisper, "There's a monster in the-" /
"$name, take my hand! Please just trust me," he says urgently. His eyes are wide and shining. His palm is extended towards you. You realize then that his hands are covered in blood, dark and seeping through his fingers. /
You let out a breath and look down at the Rapids, then up at his face. /
[[75->Take his hand.]]
[[33->Let go.]]
`,
40: `
As soon as you step into the ravine, you notice that the dirt feels softer underfoot. It's darker, too, freshly decomposed. The walls of the ravine are long, jutting pieces of rock that stick out of the ground like a huge ribcage. As you continue further, they finally become solid rock walls, blocking out any remaining light. /
You brush your hand along the stone and dust floats up into the air. No one has been here for a long time. The deer disappears behind a slab of rock and you follow, but as soon as you reach the place you last saw him, you realize he's gone. You search the soil for his tracks, but there are none. /
(/$name.../) /
You whip around, checking that you're alone. /
"Hello?" you yell. /
(/$name... can't you see me? Can't you hear me?/) calls the voice, travelling on the wind towards you. You step toward it, feeling drawn to the calm lilting tone that feels oh-so-familiar. /
You begin to move towards the voice. It's like nothing you've heard before, and yet you want so badly to follow it. You want to understand. /
You need to understand. /
[[59->Follow the voice.]]
`,
41: `
`,
42: `
You walk quickly down one of the tunnels, but almost immediately become lost. All the dark walls and endless rock start to look the same. As you wander aimlessly, your heart pounding, you realize that the tunnels are sloped downhill. You are going into the underbelly of the cave system. /
You reach a strange, crumbling archway. It leads through a section of geometric rock and into a large chamber. You examine the patterns in the rock for a moment. If you didn't know better, you would say it was manmade. You shake the thought away and continue through the tunnel. Your footsteps clatter and echo as you enter the huge room. /
There's no questioning it now. You realize now that you're at the foot of what looks like an amphitheater, carved from solid stone and large enough to seat hundreds. In the center of the highest stair is a plateau, on which sits a throne. You climb up to the throne and examine it. /
It's old, you know that for sure. It's made from something you can't identify, like pale white stone, and at the same time it's brittle enough to break under your fingers. At the foot of the throne is an old, ceremonial-looking blade. A young and childish part of you smiles at the sight. If you weren't so scared, discovering this strange, underground palace would be the adventure that you'd always craved. /
[[82->Sit on the throne.]]
[[83->Take the ceremonial sword.]]
`,
43: `
`,
44: `
`,
45: `
You make it to the rapids as the sun begins to set, touching down on the peaks of the horizon. /
You climb to the clifftop. The rapids run below - screaming and rushing over river rocks and then toppling off of the falls. Cresting the edge of the cliff above the rapids, only a few feet from you, is Devil's Rock. You approach it with a sense of awe. /
You've never seen it before, but it still feels familiar. It's black like obsidian, with inscriptions sketched in white. Along one side is unfamiliar writing in another language, printed in small tilted handwriting. On the other side of the rock's oblong form is a drawing of a rabbit. Its eyes are wide and its gaze rests far away, on the horizon. /
You move closer to the rock and examine the way that the inscriptions lie gently across the stone, like they were carved by the river itself. /
You freeze when you feel something behind you, like a sixth sense. There's something, or someone, there and you can feel their breath. You can't hear anything over the crashing of the rapids, but your heart begins to race. /
[[30->Don't move.]]
[[27->Turn around.]]
`,
46: `
You decide to trust Finn. /
"Yeah, I trust you," you say. /
A disturbingly grotesque smile forms on Finn's face, as he begins to slowly shepherd you towards the edge of the cliff. /
"W-what are you d-doing, Finn?!" you ask, now beginning to feel just a little bit afraid. /
"Nothing, $name. You said you trusted me... have you changed your mind?" hisses Finn. /
You look hopefully at Finn in a desperate attempt to prevent your inevitable death. Unfortunately, he doesn't slow down. Your feet reach the edge. Small clumps of dirt fall from the cliff into the rapids. As you look down toward your demise, you feel his hands on your back, sending you careening into the rapids. /
You are dead.
`,
47: `
"No, I don't trust you..." you mutter, quietly. You instinctively take a step back. /
His eyes darken, deep shadows growing beneath them. "(/Oh/)?" Finn growls, with more than just a hint of anger in his voice. His voice is different from the Finn you know; it's harsher, deeper. /
"I like you, Finn. I do, I just—" you start to say, but before you can finish, he steps towards you. A disturbingly grotesque smile forms on Finn's face, as he begins to slowly shepherd you towards the edge of the cliff.  /
"Hey! D-don't come any closer," you tell him. /
He continues his pursuit, ignoring your demands. He smiles again, showing his teeth. Something about them is unsettling, almost as if they're not quite... human. His canines are too long, his teeth are too sharp. /
Your feet reach the edge of the cliff. Small pebbles and clumps of dirt tumble into the Rapids. /
[[48->Run away.]]
[[49->Push him into The Rapids.]]
`,
48: `
`,
49: `
Finn closes the last few inches between you, and as his hands reach for you, you reel back. His nails are long and sharp - they cut into your neck as he presses them into the delicate skin beneath your chin. But your hands bunch the fabric of his shirt, twisting him so that your positions are reversed. /
His feet graze the edge of the cliff above the rapids and for a moment, you think that he'll pull you off the cliff with him. You push at him but his grip is unrelenting around your throat. You gasp for air but there's none to be found. /
"P-please!" you rasp, "Why, Finn?" /
He smiles one last time. You can feel your own blood, warm and thick, rushing down your skin and over his hands. "Because I'm the wolf," he says. He growls and lunges toward you, trying to throw you to the ground. /
But you duck forward, breaking his grip and darting behind him. With the last gasps of energy you have left, you shove him as hard as you can. His eyes widen, but it's too late. Within a second, the wind swallows him into the depths of the rapids. /
And then you're alone. You fall to the ground and the soft grass envelops you. You don't want to move. You're so tired... so, so tired. How easy would it be to just give in and fall asleep? How easy... /
But you're afraid you might not wake up. It takes everything you have to sit up. The grass beneath you is stained with blood, and so are your clothes. You hold up a hand to your neck and feel warm liquid seeping between your fingers. Beside you, your phone starts to ring. /
[[84->Stop the bleeding.]]
[[85->Answer the phone.]]
`,
50: `
You turn. A man stalks towards you slowly, like a lion. /
You've never seen this man before. His eyes are red and he's wearing black robes that are matted and torn. He's holding an antler with its point sharpened into points as sharp as knives and he's approaching you. You stumble back and he growls, deep and animalistic. /
He's walking with a slight limp and you think you could outrun him. But you can't leave Finn. As you back away from him, your shoulder brushes one of the low hanging stalactites. You wonder if you might be able to use it as a weapon. Your eyes dart to it and your hand itches to grab hold of it. /
The man seems to sense what you're trying to do and he growls again. Blood drips from his hand where he holds the antlers. /
[[71->Use the stalactite as a weapon.]]
[[72->Try to reason.]]
[[73->Run.]]
`,
51: `
You start untying Finn, your hands shaking as you pull at the rope and your nails scrape against his arm. You free him from the stalagmite, but his hands are still bound. You pull him up and he motions with his head toward one of the tunnels. /
The two of you start to run down the tunnels, Finn slightly ahead of you. When you reach a fork in the tunnels, Finn goes to the right automatically. Like he's been here before. Like he's done this before. He checks to make sure you're following. /

The stone grates and a small opening entrances in the cave wall. You hear footsteps growing closer, clapping against stone in the distance. He motions for you to go through. /
"Trust me," he says, "Please, just trust me." /
"I..." you start, faltering.
His brown eyes are wide in fear and he shifts his weight. "Please, $name. They'll be here any moment, and we need to go." /
[[76->Go through.]]
[[77->Question Finn.]]

52: `
`,
53: `

55: `
You lift the branch into the air above the deer, and bring it down hard. But this time, the deer dodges to the side and you fall over. You yelp in pain as you fall onto the exposed roots of a tree, the impact knocking the branch out of your hand. /
You lie sprawled on the ground, knowing you can’t get up quickly enough, as the deer towers above you. You close your eyes as his antlers descend towards you, like a sword piercing through the air. The last thing you feel is the stab of regret and antler into flesh. /
You are dead. /

61: `
You crawl forward for a short while, the mud beneath you sticking to your clothing and weighing you down. You eventually reach the edge of what you assume to be a short drop, but as you climb down, the ground gives way beneath you and you tumble off the ledge. /
Your regrets flood your mind just like the water seeps into your clothes. The water of the rapids is as cold as ice against your skin as you are pulled into the currents and thrust over the edge of the falls. /
For a moment, you feel weightless. Maybe you could survive this after all? /
And then the ground comes up to meet you, and your body is careened into solid rock. /
You are dead.

You crawl along the ground blindly and follow the sound. Your eyes burn and you can still feel the phantom slice of acid against your skin. As your hands feel along the mud, you grip something smooth and cold and you stop moving. It feels like a stone, but along its surface you can feel symbols etched into it. /
You put the stone into your pocket and freeze when you hear something move near you. /
You can see only darkness, and the pulsing of your heart seems to converge in on you like a physical pressure around your throat. The mud is slick beneath your hands as you press yourself into the ground, praying that you're alone. /

He takes a step towards you. "Back away," he growls, his head twitching to one side. "Your... friend," he spits out the word, "needs to die." /
You step in front of Finn, your heart pounding. You wonder if this is the right way to die. If you had to look back on your life and whether you did the right thing, you aren't sure if you would regret this choice. How could you know the right choice when you don't understand anything at all? /
Finn has tears in his eyes, "I don't understand. Please, don't hurt me. Please please please," he begs, his words jumbling together. /
"Get out of the way," the man orders. /
You stand your ground. "Why?" you ask, "Why do you need to hurt him? What has he done?" /
"You think you're protecting the innocent, don't you?" the man sneers, "This is no friend of yours. He's not even human. He's something more... something made by the forest itself." /
Finn is struggling and screaming, "Don't! Please!" He thrashes against the ropes. /
"Hear how easily he imitates your friend Finn?" the man asks. Your blood freezes in your veins and the man bears needle sharp teeth at you in a terrifying kind of smile. "I'm not going to ask you again. If you don't move, I will kill you." /
